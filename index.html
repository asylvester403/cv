          <p2>About Me</p2>
            <p>My name is Alex Sylvester, and if you are reading this, you are seeing my portfolio in my attempt to secure a web development position!
            <br>
            <br>I have always been a curious person, and my journey with web development is no different. I started learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in February 2020 when I heard that people could be self taught developers. I watched Youtube videos about Python to get my feet wet, and decided that I wanted my developmental start to be visually focused, so I could be able to quantify what I was learning immediately.
            <br>
            <br>I still have a lot to learn, but I feel that I have built a solid foundation for myself and I feel that I can provide a lot to a front end web developer position as well as an ongoing learning and application of the craft.
            </p>
            <br>

          <p2>My Education</p2>
            <p>I went to study for a Bachelor's degree in Psychology at Utah Valley University. However, after starting my web developing journey my priorities have shifted towards finding a job in this field instead. Psychology is another huge passion of mine and I am excited to use that knowledge to create websites that are intuitive for everyone to use!     
            <br>
            <br>A lot of my baseline knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript teaching have been from trial and error creating and adjusting very small projects. I also have experience Googling around for solutions to my problems using W3schools and Stack Overflow. Lastly, I am also very willing to take a new concept, practice and apply it into my project, and see just how far I can stretch it to make it look as fantastic as possible. The restaurant website featured below was originally going to have scroll locking because I thought it would look nice, but I found out how to create parallax backgrounds. I fell in love with that style and attempted to see what limitations and what bells and whistles I could create in a parallax style. 
            </p>
            <br>

          <p2>My Promise To You</p2>
            <p>I may be a green developer, but my promise is that what I lack in experience I will make up for in passion and adaptability. I will work to fit whatever mold you require and I will become a fantastic part of any web development team that would have me!</p>
